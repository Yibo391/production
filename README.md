# B3 Production

Video
-----------------------------

This is a recorded presentation, for stating how it works



### Start it

[This is a link to my b3 index page](https://cscloud7-164.lnu.se/b3)        https://cscloud7-164.lnu.se/b3

[This is a link to my b3 issue page](https://cscloud7-164.lnu.se/b3/issues)     https://cscloud7-164.lnu.se/b3/issues

- [x] When a client connects to the application it will contact GitLab through their REST API and fetch all created issues on your repository. The response will be in JSON, which is good because we work with Node.js.
- [x] When your application gets the issue list from GitLab, you should use that to render the HTML-page for the client along with the JavaScript needed for the client.
- [x] One thing the client script needs to do is, for example, the ability to connect to your serverÂ´s WebSocket channel.

- [x] When a new "issue-event" happens on GitLab they will fire a (by you) registered HTTP POST which should point to your application.

- [x] The webhook will send you data and your application should use the web
- [x] socket channel(s) to update the client in real-time. your code must check that the webhook POST comes from GitLab.
- [x] Along with your code, and installation scripts you should also commit an assignment report that answers some questions (see below).
- [x] You are free to choose and use third-party packages to solve the problem but they should be mention and motivated in your assignment report.
